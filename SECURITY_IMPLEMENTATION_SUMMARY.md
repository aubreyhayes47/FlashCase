# Security, Moderation & Legal Disclaimers Implementation Summary

## Overview
This document summarizes the implementation of security, content moderation, and legal disclaimers for the FlashCase application as outlined in the requirements.

## Date
October 21, 2025

## Implemented Features

### 1. JWT Authentication & Password Hashing ✅

#### Implementation Details
- **JWT Token Authentication**: Implemented using `python-jose[cryptography]` library
- **OAuth2 Password Flow**: Standard OAuth2PasswordBearer for secure token-based authentication
- **Password Hashing**: Using `passlib[bcrypt]` with bcrypt algorithm for secure password storage
- **Token Expiration**: Configurable token expiration (default: 30 minutes)
- **Protected Endpoints**: All deck, card, study, and report endpoints require authentication

#### Security Features
- Passwords are never stored in plain text
- Bcrypt hashing with automatic salt generation
- JWT tokens contain user identification and expiration time
- Token validation on every protected endpoint request
- Active user verification before granting access

#### Test Coverage
- 15 comprehensive tests for authentication
- Tests cover: registration, login, token validation, password hashing, expired tokens
- All tests passing

### 2. Content Moderation System ✅

#### Automated Profanity Filter
- **Implementation**: Custom profanity filter service (`app/services/moderation.py`)
- **Coverage**: Checks deck names, descriptions, and card front/back content
- **Method**: Regex-based pattern matching with word boundaries
- **Profanity List**: Extensible list of inappropriate words and variations
- **Action**: Rejects content creation/update with HTTP 400 error

#### Integration Points
- Deck creation endpoint: Validates name and description
- Deck update endpoint: Validates updated fields
- Card creation endpoint: Validates front and back content
- Card update endpoint: Validates updated fields

#### Test Coverage
- 20 tests for profanity filter and moderation
- Tests cover: clean content, profanity detection, case sensitivity, word boundaries
- Integration tests for deck and card creation/updates
- All tests passing

### 3. User Reporting System ✅

#### Report Model
- **Fields**: reporter_id, report_type, content_id, reason, description, status, admin_notes
- **Report Types**: deck, card, user
- **Reasons**: inappropriate_content, spam, harassment, incorrect_information, copyright_violation, other
- **Status**: pending, under_review, resolved, dismissed

#### Endpoints
- `POST /api/v1/reports/`: Create a new report (authenticated users only)
- `GET /api/v1/reports/`: List user's own reports (with optional status filter)
- `GET /api/v1/reports/{id}`: Get specific report details (owner only)

#### Security Features
- Authentication required for all report operations
- Users can only view their own reports
- Reports automatically set to "pending" status
- Admin review fields prepared for future admin functionality

#### Test Coverage
- 13 tests for reporting system
- Tests cover: report creation, listing, filtering, authorization, different report types
- All tests passing

### 4. Legal & AI Disclaimers ✅

#### Legal Disclaimer Component
- **Location**: `frontend/components/LegalDisclaimer.tsx`
- **Purpose**: Clarifies that FlashCase does not provide legal advice
- **Styling**: Yellow alert box with warning icon for high visibility
- **Message**: Clear statement about educational purpose and need for professional legal consultation

#### AI Disclaimer Component
- **Location**: `frontend/components/AIDisclaimer.tsx`
- **Purpose**: Warns users about AI-generated content limitations
- **Styling**: Blue info box with information icon
- **Message**: Explains potential for errors in AI content and need for verification

#### Integration
- **Study Page**: Legal disclaimer displayed prominently
- **Create Page**: Both legal and AI disclaimers shown
- **Discover Page**: Legal disclaimer displayed
- **Visibility**: Disclaimers appear at the top of content areas, impossible to miss

## Security Audit Results

### CodeQL Analysis
- **Date**: October 21, 2025

- Reporting system
- Frontend disclaimer components

## Test Results Summary

### Backend Tests
- **Total Tests**: 93
- **Passed**: 93
- **Failed**: 0
- **Status**: ✅ ALL PASSING

#### Test Breakdown
- Authentication tests: 15 passing
- Moderation tests: 20 passing
- Reporting tests: 13 passing
- Protected endpoints tests: 23 passing
- SRS tests: 15 passing
- AI tests: 7 passing

### Notable Test Categories
1. **Password Security**: Verified bcrypt hashing, no plain text storage
2. **JWT Tokens**: Validated token creation, expiration, and verification
3. **Profanity Filter**: Tested pattern matching, word boundaries, case insensitivity
4. **Content Moderation**: Verified rejection of inappropriate content at API level
5. **Report Authorization**: Confirmed users can only access their own reports

## Dependencies Added
No new dependencies were required. All implementation uses existing packages:
- `python-jose[cryptography]`: Already in requirements.txt
- `passlib[bcrypt]`: Already in requirements.txt

## Configuration
All security settings are configurable via environment variables:
```
SECRET_KEY=<your-secret-key>
ALGORITHM=HS256
ACCESS_TOKEN_EXPIRE_MINUTES=30
```

## Acceptance Criteria Status

✅ **JWT auth implemented and tested; passwords hashed (bcrypt)**
- Complete JWT authentication with OAuth2
- Bcrypt password hashing with passlib
- 15 passing tests

✅ **Automated profanity filter applied on deck and card submission**
- Custom profanity filter service
- Integrated into all content creation/update endpoints
- 20 passing tests

✅ **User reporting flow implemented and flagged for admin review**
- Complete Report model with status tracking
- User reporting endpoints
- Reports default to "pending" for admin review
- 13 passing tests

✅ **Prominent disclaimers for 'No Legal Advice' and 'AI Content' displayed in relevant UIs**

- AI disclaimer component on Create page
- Prominent, impossible-to-miss styling
- Screenshots show implementation

## Security Best Practices Implemented

1. **Password Security**
   - Bcrypt hashing with automatic salts
   - No plain text password storage
   - Passwords excluded from API responses

2. **Authentication**
   - JWT tokens with expiration
   - Token validation on protected endpoints
   - Active user verification

3. **Authorization**
   - Users can only access their own data
   - Protected endpoints require valid tokens
   - Report access restricted to owners

4. **Content Safety**
   - Automated profanity filtering
   - User reporting mechanism
   - Admin review workflow prepared

5. **Legal Protection**
   - Clear "No Legal Advice" disclaimers
   - AI content accuracy warnings
   - Prominent display on all relevant pages

## Future Enhancements

While all acceptance criteria are met, potential future improvements include:

1. **Admin Dashboard**

   - Ability to update report status
   - Content moderation actions

2. **Enhanced Profanity Filter**
   - Machine learning-based detection
   - Context-aware filtering
   - Multiple language support

3. **Disclaimer Acceptance**

   - Legal disclaimer acceptance on signup

4. **Rate Limiting**
   - Already implemented via SlowAPI
   - Can be tuned based on usage patterns

## Conclusion

All acceptance criteria have been successfully implemented and tested:
- ✅ JWT authentication with bcrypt password hashing
