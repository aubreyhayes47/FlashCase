# Study API Testing Summary

## Date: October 21, 2025

## Overview
This document summarizes the testing performed on the newly implemented Study API endpoints for the FlashCase spaced repetition system.

## Endpoints Tested

### 1. GET /api/v1/study/session/{deck_id}
**Purpose**: Retrieve cards due for review in a specific deck for a user.

**Test Results**:
- ✅ Successfully retrieves new cards (never studied before)
- ✅ Returns cards with default SRS values (ease_factor=2.5, interval=0, repetitions=0)
- ✅ Excludes cards that are not yet due based on their due_date
- ✅ Respects the limit parameter for pagination
- ✅ Returns empty array for decks with no cards
- ✅ Orders cards by due_date (oldest first)

**Example Request**:
```bash
curl "http://localhost:8000/api/v1/study/session/2?user_id=2"
```

**Example Response**:
```json
[
    {
        "id": 3,
        "deck_id": 2,
        "front": "Question 1",
        "back": "Answer 1",
        "ease_factor": 2.5,
        "interval": 0,
        "repetitions": 0,
        "due_date": "2025-10-21T03:45:00.332703"
    }
]
```

### 2. POST /api/v1/study/review/{card_id}
**Purpose**: Submit a review for a card and update study progress using SM-2 algorithm.

**Test Results**:
- ✅ Correctly processes quality ratings 0-5
- ✅ First repetition (quality ≥ 3): interval = 1 day
- ✅ Second repetition (quality ≥ 3): interval = 6 days
- ✅ Third+ repetition (quality ≥ 3): interval = previous_interval * ease_factor
- ✅ Incorrect response (quality < 3): resets repetitions to 0, interval to 1 day
- ✅ Validates quality rating (rejects values outside 0-5 range with 400 error)
- ✅ Returns 404 for non-existent cards
- ✅ Updates ease_factor based on quality rating
- ✅ Enforces ease_factor floor of 1.3 (ease-hell mitigation)

**Example Request**:
```bash
curl -X POST "http://localhost:8000/api/v1/study/review/3" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"user_id": 2, "quality": 5}'
```

**Example Response**:
```json
{
    "card_id": 3,
    "quality": 5,
    "new_ease_factor": 2.6,
    "new_interval": 1,
    "new_repetitions": 1,
    "next_due_date": "2025-10-22T03:45:09.220511"
}
```

## SM-2 Algorithm Unit Tests
All 15 unit tests for the SM-2 algorithm passed successfully:

### Test Coverage:
- ✅ Perfect response on first repetition
- ✅ Perfect response on second repetition
- ✅ Perfect response on third+ repetition
- ✅ Correct response with hesitation (quality 4)
- ✅ Correct response with difficulty (quality 3)
- ✅ Incorrect response resets repetitions
- ✅ Complete blackout (quality 0)
- ✅ Ease factor floor enforcement (1.3 minimum)
- ✅ Invalid quality raises ValueError
- ✅ Realistic progression sequence
- ✅ Due date calculation from current time
- ✅ Due date calculation from base date
- ✅ Due date with zero interval
- ✅ Due date with large interval (365 days)

## Manual Testing Results

### Test Scenario 1: New Card Review Sequence
1. Get study session → 3 new cards returned ✅
2. Review card with quality 5 → interval=1, repetitions=1, EF=2.6 ✅
3. Review same card with quality 5 → interval=6, repetitions=2, EF=2.7 ✅
4. Get study session → reviewed card not in list (due in 6 days) ✅

### Test Scenario 2: Incorrect Response Handling
1. Review card with quality 2 → repetitions=0, interval=1 ✅
2. Verify ease factor decreased but stayed above 1.3 floor ✅

### Test Scenario 3: Input Validation
1. Review with quality=10 → 400 error returned ✅
2. Review non-existent card → 404 error returned ✅

### Test Scenario 4: Ease-Hell Mitigation
1. Multiple reviews with low quality (3) → ease factor never below 1.3 ✅

## Database Schema Verification
The updated StudyLog model includes all required fields:
- ✅ `due_date` - When the card is due for review (indexed)
- ✅ `interval` - Days until next review
- ✅ `repetitions` - Number of consecutive correct repetitions
- ✅ `ease_factor` - Current ease factor (floor of 1.3)
- ✅ `last_rating` - Most recent quality rating (0-5)
- ✅ `reviewed_at` - Timestamp of last review
- ✅ `next_review` - Calculated next review date
- ✅ Foreign keys to user and card tables

## Performance Notes
- Database queries are efficient with proper indexing on user_id, card_id, and due_date
- Study session endpoint filters cards efficiently using database queries
- No N+1 query issues observed

## Acceptance Criteria Verification

### ✅ calculate_sm2 implemented according to spec
- Intervals: First=1 day, Second=6 days, Subsequent=interval*EF
- EF floor: 1.3 enforced in all cases
- Ease-hell mitigation: Working correctly

### ✅ StudyLog model exists and stores required fields
- due_date: ✅
- interval: ✅
- repetitions: ✅
- ease_factor: ✅
- last_rating: ✅

### ✅ GET /api/v1/study/session/{deck_id} returns due cards
- Endpoint implemented and tested
- Returns cards due for review
- Excludes cards not yet due
- Handles new cards correctly

### ✅ POST /api/v1/study/review/{card_id} updates StudyLog correctly
- Creates new StudyLog entries
- Updates all SRS parameters correctly
- Validates input
- Returns comprehensive response

## Known Issues
None identified during testing.

## Recommendations for Future Enhancements
1. Add authentication/authorization to endpoints
2. Add batch review endpoint for multiple cards
3. Add statistics endpoint for user study progress
4. Consider adding study streaks tracking
5. Add support for timezone-aware datetime handling

## Conclusion
All acceptance criteria have been met. The SM-2 algorithm is correctly implemented with ease-hell mitigation, and both study endpoints are functioning as specified. The system is ready for integration with the frontend application.
