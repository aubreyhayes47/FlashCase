3. **Speed Matters**: Fast loading, quick interactions, efficient workflows
4. **Trust Through Transparency**: Show why cards are scheduled, how algorithms work
5. **Encourage Progress**: Celebrate wins, maintain motivation
6. **Respect Time**: Every feature should save time or improve outcomes

### Development Principles

3. **Attribution**: Credit creators, respect intellectual property
4. **Diversity**: Support different learning styles and study approaches
5. **Currency**: Keep content updated with latest case law and changes

## Risks & Mitigation

### Market Risks
- **Risk**: Law students already committed to existing tools (Anki, Quizlet)
- **Mitigation**: Focus on differentiation (AI, law-specific), make migration easy

- **Risk**: Market too niche, limited growth potential
- **Mitigation**: Expand to bar candidates, pre-law, paralegals, international students

### Product Risks
- **Risk**: AI-generated content has errors, damages credibility
- **Mitigation**: Human review, confidence scores, community reporting

- **Risk**: Spaced repetition algorithm not optimal for legal content
- **Mitigation**: Research legal education, A/B test algorithms, allow customization

### Business Risks
- **Risk**: Unable to monetize effectively, students won't pay
- **Mitigation**: Freemium model, keep core features free, premium adds-on

- **Risk**: AI costs too high, unit economics don't work
- **Mitigation**: Batch processing, cache common requests, usage limits

### Competitive Risks
- **Risk**: Anki or Quizlet adds law-specific features
- **Mitigation**: Build moat through community content and superior UX

- **Risk**: Commercial bar prep companies copy features
- **Mitigation**: Focus on continuous innovation, student-centric pricing
