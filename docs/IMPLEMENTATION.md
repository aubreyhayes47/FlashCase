- **Content moderation** to maintain community standards
- **Input validation** at multiple layers

## Testing Coverage

### Backend Tests: 126 Passing, 13 Failing
- **Authentication**: 15 tests passing
- **Protected Endpoints**: 28 tests passing
- **SRS Algorithm**: 15 tests passing

- Scheduled for fix in next iteration

## Performance Considerations

### Database
- SQLite adequate for MVP and small deployments
- Indexes on frequently queried fields
- Connection pooling ready for production database
- Migration to PostgreSQL recommended for production

### API Performance
- Async/await patterns for non-blocking I/O
- Rate limiting prevents abuse
- Health check endpoints for monitoring
- Structured logging for debugging

### AI Cost Control
- Token limits per endpoint
- Per-user rate limiting
- Usage tracking and alerts
- Configurable thresholds

## Configuration

See `.env.example` files in root and backend directories for complete configuration options.

### Required Configuration
- `SECRET_KEY` - JWT signing key (must be changed from default)
- `DATABASE_URL` - Database connection string

### Optional Configuration
- `GROK_API_KEY` - For AI features
- `COURTLISTENER_API_KEY` - For legal case data
- Rate limiting settings
- Token usage thresholds
- CORS origins

## Deployment Considerations

### Development
- Docker Compose provides complete local environment
- Hot-reload enabled for both frontend and backend
- SQLite database persists in volume

### Production
- Switch to PostgreSQL database
- Use production CORS settings
- Enable structured logging
- Set production SECRET_KEY
- Configure monitoring and alerts
- Consider serverless or container orchestration

### Supported Platforms
- Render (recommended for MVP)
- Heroku
- AWS (ECS/Fargate)
- Google Cloud (Cloud Run)
- DigitalOcean App Platform

See [DEPLOYMENT.md](../DEPLOYMENT.md) for detailed deployment guides.

## Known Issues

1. **Admin Report Management**: Some report-related tests failing
   - 13 tests failing in reporting system
   - Admin endpoints may need refinement
   - User reporting still functional

2. **Deprecation Warnings**: datetime.utcnow() usage
   - Multiple deprecation warnings in tests
   - Should migrate to datetime.now(datetime.UTC)
   - Not affecting functionality currently

3. **Frontend API Integration**: Placeholder implementations
   - Frontend pages exist but API integration incomplete
   - Authentication flow needs frontend implementation
   - Study session UI needs connection to backend

## Next Steps

### Short Term (Current Sprint)
1. Fix failing report-related tests
2. Complete frontend API integration
3. Implement authentication UI
4. Add study session UI

### Medium Term (Next 2-3 Sprints)
1. Build admin dashboard UI
2. Implement deck discovery/search
3. Add user profile pages
4. Enhance study statistics

### Long Term (Future Releases)
1. Mobile-responsive improvements
2. Advanced analytics
3. Export/import functionality
4. Collaborative features
5. Mobile app considerations
