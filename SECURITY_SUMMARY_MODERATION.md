## Date
October 21, 2025

## Overview
This document summarizes the security, moderation, and legal disclaimer features implemented for FlashCase as part of the security and compliance requirements.

## Implementation Status: ✅ COMPLETE

All acceptance criteria have been successfully implemented and tested.

## Features Implemented

### 1. JWT Authentication & Password Hashing ✅

**Status**: Already implemented, verified and tested

**Implementation Details**:
- JWT tokens using python-jose with HS256 algorithm
- Password hashing with bcrypt via passlib
- Token expiration: 30 minutes (configurable)
- Secure token validation and decoding

**Security Measures**:
- Passwords never stored in plain text
- Automatic salting with bcrypt
- Token tampering detection
- Expired token rejection
- Stateless authentication

**Test Coverage**: 15 tests passing
- User registration validation
- Login with correct/incorrect credentials
- Token generation and validation
- Password hashing verification
- Token expiration handling

**Files**:
- `/backend/app/core/security.py` - Password hashing and JWT functions
- `/backend/app/core/auth.py` - Authentication dependencies
- `/backend/app/routers/auth.py` - Auth endpoints
- `/backend/tests/test_auth.py` - Authentication tests

### 2. Automated Content Moderation ✅

**Library**: `better-profanity` v0.7.0

**Implementation**:
Automated profanity filtering applied to all user-generated content:
- Deck names and descriptions
- Card front and back text
- Real-time validation on create/update operations

**How It Works**:
```python
# Content validation before save
is_valid, error_message = validate_deck_content(name, description)
if not is_valid:
    raise HTTPException(status_code=400, detail=error_message)
```

**Protected Endpoints**:
- `POST /api/v1/decks/` - Create deck with moderation
- `PUT /api/v1/decks/{deck_id}` - Update deck with moderation
- `POST /api/v1/cards/` - Create card with moderation
- `PUT /api/v1/cards/{card_id}` - Update card with moderation

**Test Coverage**: 18 tests passing
- Service-level profanity detection
- Text censoring functionality
- Deck content validation (name, description)
- Card content validation (front, back)
- API endpoint integration tests
- Update operation validation

**Files**:
- `/backend/app/services/content_moderation.py` - Moderation service
- `/backend/app/routers/decks.py` - Deck endpoints with moderation
- `/backend/app/routers/cards.py` - Card endpoints with moderation
- `/backend/tests/test_content_moderation.py` - Moderation tests
- `/backend/requirements.txt` - Added better-profanity dependency

### 3. User Reporting System ✅

**Implementation**:
Complete user reporting system with admin review capabilities.

**Report Types**:
- `deck` - Report an entire deck
- `card` - Report a specific card

**Report Reasons**:
- `inappropriate` - Offensive or inappropriate content
- `spam` - Spam or low-quality content
- `copyright` - Copyright infringement
- `misleading` - Incorrect or misleading information
- `other` - Other issues

**Report Statuses**:
- `pending` - Awaiting admin review
- `reviewed` - Admin has reviewed
- `resolved` - Issue has been addressed
- `dismissed` - Report was invalid

**User Capabilities**:
- Create reports for inappropriate content
- View their own submitted reports
- Provide detailed descriptions

**Admin Capabilities**:
- View all reports (with filtering)
- Review individual reports
- Update report status
- Add admin notes
- Delete reports

**Database Schema**:
```python
class Report(SQLModel, table=True):
    id: int
    reporter_id: int  # FK to user
    report_type: ReportType
    content_id: int
    reason: ReportReason
    description: Optional[str]
    status: ReportStatus
    reviewed_by: Optional[int]  # FK to admin user
    admin_notes: Optional[str]
    created_at: datetime
    updated_at: datetime
```

**User Model Enhancement**:
Added `is_admin` field to User model to support admin privileges.

**Test Coverage**: 17 tests passing
- Report creation (success, validation, auth)
